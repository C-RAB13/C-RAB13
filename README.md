- 👋 Hi, I’m @C-RAB13
- 👀 I’m interested in TOO many things! Some would say it's my ADHD, others like myself would say, "...sorry ...what? do  you think that bird is going to poop on that dog?"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of everything, just enough to sound interesting at parties, but if the conversation lasts too long, they know I'm full of shit. currently that topic is AI image generation, I also wish i paid more attention in school to learn how to code. and had more time and focus these days to teach myself and trying to figure out how to use it to replace my shitty 9-5 job
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that try to counterbalance the shit-show that is society right now. Why the fuck can't everyone just get along? We don't all have to be friends, but fuck, hate shouldn't be our first reaction.
- 📫 How to reach me: No links for socials  hmmm.... not ready for that
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ?
